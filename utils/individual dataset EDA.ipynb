    "We evaluated the vision capabilities of the GPT-4o language model (identifier gpt-4o-2024-05-13) using a series of tasks that assess its performance on visual understanding and reasoning. For each task, a dataset of approximately 100 representative images was curated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was provided an image along with a text prompt specifying the desired output format. The prompts were designed to probe the model's ability to identify, classify, describe, and analyze visual content without additional context. For select tasks, we further investigated the model's few-shot learning capabilities by providing a small number of labeled examples before the query image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model outputs were compared against ground truth labels to compute standard performance metrics such as accuracy. Qualitative analysis was also conducted on a subset of responses to identify common failure modes and strengths. The results across different tasks provide insights into GPT-4o's current visual understanding capabilities, areas for improvement, and potential as a foundation model for vision tasks.\n",

    "Subsequent sections delve into the specifics of each task, dataset, and findings, offering a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4o's visual reasoning skills and informing future research directions for large language models applied to multimodal tasks.\n",
