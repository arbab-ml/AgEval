Project: Adaptive Few-Shot Learning for Image Classification

1. Main implementation: @inference.py

2. Objective: Enhance model performance by providing smart few-shot examples

3. Method:
   a. Analyze the current input image
   b. Select similar examples from the training set
   c. Use these similar examples as few-shot prompts

4. Rationale: Similar examples improve model performance more effectively than random ones

5. Implementation steps:
   a. Utilize CLIP embeddings from @get_embeddingp.py as the similarity metric for images
   b. Create an efficient indexing system for a curated set of example images
   c. Integrate adaptive example selection into @inference.py using CLIP embeddings
   d. Evaluate and compare performance with random few-shot selection

6. Expected outcome: Improved accuracy and generalization in image classification tasks
