    \subsection{Tables}

    All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
    title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

    Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
    table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
    be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
    numbered consecutively.

    Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
    strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
    typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
    \begin{center}
    \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
    \end{center}
    This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

    \begin{table}
    \caption{Sample table title}
    \label{sample-table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
        \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
        \cmidrule(r){1-2}
        Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
        \midrule
        Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
        Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
        Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    </tables_rules>
    <figures_rules>
        \subsection{Figures}
        \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
        \caption{Sample figure caption.}
        \end{figure}


        All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
        purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
        figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
        the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
        proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.


        You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
        paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
        color.

<project_details>
This paper explores enhancing few-shot learning in vision-language models through Assisted Few-Shot Learning. The research focuses on improving image classification tasks with limited annotated data by leveraging multiple image encoders: Vision Transformer (ViT), ResNet-50, and CLIP encoder.

The proposed method, Assisted Few-Shot Learning, aims to enhance model performance by providing smart few-shot examples. It involves:

1. Analyzing the current input image
2. Selecting similar examples from the training set
3. Using these similar examples as few-shot prompts
4. Evaluating and comparing performance with random few-shot selection

This approach is based on the rationale that similar examples improve model performance more effectively than random ones.

additional considration: 
When given raw log of results, Remember the true scores are only in embedding (clip, resnet, vit). For random, its just repetition, so can only consider the scores in 'clip' section of random. AGain, use all in embeddings.
